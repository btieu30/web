    <h2>What is the Guess the Number Game?</h2>
      <p>
        Guess the Number is a game where a random number is selected between a specific range (which is typically given to the player). It is then up to the player to guess the correct number, usually within a given number of tries.
      </p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        Although the game conventionally gives players a limited amount of guesses, there is no restriction within my Python program on the number of guesses. In the Python program, a random number between 0-30 (inclusive) is generated. Once the player makes their first guess, if that guess is wrong, they are given hints to guide them towards guessing the right number. There are only two options for the hints, which denote within the Python shell if the player's most recent guess was too low or too high. This continues until the player guesses correctly. Once the player guesses correctly, a graph will appear on the screen showing the game overview. The game overview simply includes a graph of the player's guesses. 
      </p>

    <h2>What is the purpose of recreating this game in Python?</h2>
       <p>
         The purpose of recreating this game is to analyze patterns in the players' guesses and see how these patterns contribute to the number of guesses it takes the player to get to the right number. The ability to graph in Python utilizing matplotlib makes this process much easier as well.
       </p>

    <h2>Player Graph Examples</h2>

      <p>
        In these graphs, we can observe specific guessing patterns of the players. For example, by Bob's graphs, we can see that he guesses a small number first, and based on the given hint, guesses a larger number. This process allows Bob to slowly narrow the 0-30 range, leading him to guess the number in 5 tries. However, we see in Lisa's graph that she first guess 15, which is the mean of the 0-30 range. From here, she is given hints that lead her to guess the number within 6 tries. Based on these two game overviews, one may assess their guessing strategies and apply this to other games in the real world.

    <h2>Resources Used</h2>
      <p>
        I used one main link to generate the CSV file containing the random integers from 0-30.
