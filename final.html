    <h2>What is the Guess the Number Game?</h2>
      <p>
        Guess the Number is a game where a random number is selected between a specific range (which is typically given to the player). It is up to the player to guess the correct number, usually within a given number of tries.
      </p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        Although the game conventionally gives players a limited amount of guesses, there is no restriction within the Python program on the number of guesses. In the Python program, a random number between 0-30 (inclusive) is generated. The player must first make a random guess and if that guess is wrong, they are given hints to guide them towards guessing the right number. There are only two options for the hints, which denote within the Python shell if the player's moost recent guess was too low or too high. This continues until the player guesses correctly. Once the player enters the right number, a graph will appear on the screen showing the game overview.

    <h2>What is the purpose of recreating this game in Python?</h2>
       <p>
         The purpose of recreating this game is to analyze patterns in the players' guesses and see how these patterns contribute to the number of guesses it takes the player to get to the right number. The ability to graph in Python ustilizing matplotlib makes the process much easier as well.

    <h2>Resources Used</h2>
      <p>
        I used one main link to generate the CSV file containing the random integers from 0-30.
