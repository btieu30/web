<h2>About UMI</h2>

<div class="about">
  <p>
    Tierra Umi Wilson, better known as UMI, was born on February 9, 1999 in Seattle, Washington to an African-American father and Japanese mother. She was taught Japanese by her mother, which has allowed UMI to create songs sung in only Japanese. UMI was surrounded by music as a child, which led to her pursuing music at a young age, with a songwriting journal ever since she was 5 years old. Her mother plays the piano while her father plays the drums. Her stage name, UMI, is her Japanese middle name, which translates to "ocean". The 22 year-old is well-known for her ability to blend unique music genres such as R&B, neo-soul and lo-fi music to make hits. UMI officially began her career in 2017, with the song "Happy Again", which has garnered over 3 million plays on the streaming platform known as Spotify and 400,000 views on Youtube.
