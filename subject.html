  <h2>UMI's Rise To Fame</h2>
  <p>
    UMI started out as a regular high school student, who enjoyed making covers for leisure. Soon, these covers started getting copyrighted and she began writing her own songs. Once she began attending college at the University of Southern California, it was difficult for her to manage school and music, so she dropped out of college. UMI truly began her rise to fame in 2018, with the hit song "Remember Me", which has over 26 million views on Youtube. Listen to the audio for "Remember Me" here:
